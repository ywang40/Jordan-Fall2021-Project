# Jordan-Fall2021-Project

## Welcome

This is the Git repo you will be using to do your research and share results with me, I will share tutorial materials and examples here with you, too.

## Getting started

1. Set up an account with the Center for Research Computing (CRC)
2. Access a front end machine ([CRC Quick Start Guide](https://docs.crc.nd.edu/new_user/quick_start.html))
    - via [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
    - via [FastX](https://docs.crc.nd.edu/general_pages/f/fastx.html?highlight=vpn)
3. Get familiar with Linux commands
    - [CRC Basic Linux Guide](https://docs.crc.nd.edu/new_user/linux_guide.html)
    - [Linux Command Cheat Sheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)
5. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and go through this useful python workshop: [Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science](http://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/index.html)
6. Setting up ASE using terminal in the Linux system
    - Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) using terminal
    - Install [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html)
        - Ensure you have a working [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)
        - [ASE installation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html) using pip
        - Add environment variables to your ~/.bashrc file
        - Test your installation
        - Try out [ase gui](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/gui/gui.html) to visualize a trajectory
8. Git

## Schedule

### Week 1:

Set up CRC account, be able to access a front end machine, folder nevigation using terminal, install Anaconda and open Jupyter notebook on the Windows machine.

### Week 2 - 4:

Be familiar with Jupyter notebook, play with code (The best way to learn Python!) illustrated in lesson 1 through 5 in Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Science workshop, and upload your ipynb notebook to this folder.

### Week 5:

Visulize example structures using ase gui, learn what a supercell is in periodic modeling, look into the chemistry in the "zeolite + organic structure-directing agent (OSDA)" system, use the Atoms object in ase.

## Meeting Information

We can update this as the semester goes along, but we can start here.
- Weekly meetings between Jordan and Yujia via Zoom or in person.
- Schneider Group touchbase meetings: Mondays at 9:30 AM via Zoom.
